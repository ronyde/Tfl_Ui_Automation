This is basic UI automation framework written using Cucumber Junit and Java(selenium). Page objects are also implemented in it. It can perform cross browser testing which is controlled via properties file.Datatables are also used in here whenever it was required. It has been developed considering the code reusability.Many utilties can be found under utilities file. This also can take basic screenshots if required and screenshot utility is used.

It lacks in some areas like reporting,excel integration etc and also hooks implementation is not there.(Hooks is written but not working may be due to some version incompatibility).These were not completed because of the time contraint.
